## Nile-Valley
This web map was created as a final project for GHY3814 a Web Mapping and GIS class at Appalachian State University.  The assignment was to find a news or magazine article online with some sort of geographic context within it and then design an interactive mapping application that enhances and the user expereience and understanding of the article.

For this project I chose an article from the [LIVESCIENCE](https://www.livescience.com/28057-ancient-egyptian-sundial-discovered.html) website titled _Ancient Egyptian Sundial Discovered at Valley of the Kings_.  The article tells the story of a team of archeologist, led by Professor Sussane Bickel, that discovered one of the oldest sundials to date. The sundial was discovered in Egypt's Nile River Valley in 2013 and dates back to the 13th century B.C., over 3500 years ago.  The sundial is made from a flattened piece of limestone on which is drawn a semicircle divided into twelve sections which are believed to represent hours or what we now refer to as hours.   Within the sections are small dots which researchers assume were used to measure more precise time.  In the center of the dial is a dent which would have likely held a wooden or metal rod.  The shadow of the rod moving through the sections of the semicircle was likely used to visualize the length of hours.

After I located pyramid location data in a .csv file format I used the [geojson](http://geojson.io/#map=2/20.0/0.0) website to save the csv file as a geojson file to be able to display the data on my map.  To design the web map I used the text editor Atom to enter the code.  To enter the code and launch my map using Atom I used html, javaScript, css, and arcgisonline.
